# service-project

> In this project, I have chosen to provide management services for a coffee shop by creating a
program of the menu management system. The program will provide the following operations
which I assumed is required for it to function.
1. Customers should be able to view the menu
2. Customers must be able to edit the order by adding/ deleting and updating drinks/items of
their choice
3. Customers should be able to search for specific drinks/items using the search option
4. Program should be able to determine customer’s orders
5. Ability to compute total price of customer’s ordered beverages
6. Based on the orders, program should display details of order in a customer receipt

P.S The program is strictly written in C++ to satiate project requirements.
